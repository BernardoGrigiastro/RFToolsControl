Upcoming:
- Fixed dropping liquid buckets in the fluid opcodes
- Small improvement on error logging. The index of the program card that is causing the error is now also printed
- If the programmer gets a redstone signal it will save the current program to the card. This allows automation to save a program to many cards
- New opcode ('eval_countcrafts') to count the possible number of crafting operations given a card and an inventory
- New opcode ('do_vector_sort') to sort a vector
- New opcodes ('do_vector_max' and 'do_vector_min') to find the index of the largest or smallest item in a vector
- New opcode ('eval_vector_indices') to generate a vector of integers starting with 0
- There was a chance that a programmer would not correctly save its current program on exit. Loading the world again would revert to an older program. This has now been fixed
- Converting a vector to a string will now give a short summary of its contents instead of just []
